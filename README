This script is intended for testing projects in the CS Intro/Modular Programming course.
The script runs all the provided tests, comparing your solution with the solution the course has
provided.
The script also performs a memory leak check with a program called valgrind (type 'valgrind --help' without quotes in your terminal/shell for more information) and displays the results.

To make the program work:
1. unpack (extract) the solution binaries (often called "school solution") named ex0a, ex1b etc, and the test files (usually named "ex0a_test00.in" and similar).
2. Move the school solution to the folder "(AutoTestScript)/sol/" (Meaning, inside the folder)
3. Move the test files to the folder "(AutoTestScript)/tests/".
4. Put the folder AutoTestScript with your project files, alongside the source file folders.
   If your main program is called ex3a.cc and it is in the folder "/home/csintro/ex3/ex3a"
   then AutoTestScript needs to be in the folder "/home/csintro/ex3/" in order to work without changing it.
4.b. Alternatively, you can copy the source file to the folder "/AutoTestScript/src/" and change a line in the
     script.
5. Run the script test.sh from your terminal using this line:
	./test.sh progname1 progname2
   For example, if we have a folder ex2a and the source file should also be ex2a then we can run:
	./test.sh ex2a
   And see the results on the terminal.
(For some users, you can run:
	test.sh progname1 progname2 progname3
 
 In some cased you need to apply the following before executing the script:
	chmod 0755 test.sh
 and then run: test.sh progname
)

Important notes:
a. In this version - program names (i.e. ex3a ect.) must be in a folder with the SAME NAME
b. Tests file names must be in this format: prog_testxx.in (i.e. ex3a_test01.in etc..)
This will be improved in future versions.
